`README for UseModWiki 1.0.6 & Fork | Last updated: May 29, 2021`

# UseModWiki
## Release notes
Visit http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl for documentation and official
announcements regarding UseModWiki.  The current documentation is minimal,
but the developers and some users will try to answer any questions.

Please send questions or comments to [usemod@usemod.com](mailto:usemod@usemod.com).

A mailing list for major UseModWiki announcements (releases and critical
bugs) is available. Send mail to usemod@usemod.com to join the list.

## Security
Wiki administrators should be aware of the risks of enabling the HTML
or email options in UseModWiki. Permitting full HTML editing allows a
malicious user to cause the browsers of other users to execute
arbitrary Javascript, Java applets, or other possible sources of
security holes.  The email option could be misused to send annoying
mail to third parties (since no validation is done on the email
addresses entered into the Preferences page).  These options may be
useful for small trusted groups, but they are not advised for wikis
open to the general public.

# Fork information
This is [5qc's](https://github.com/5qc) fork of UseModWiki. This was made mainly just to
modernize the wiki a little bit, and fix any bugs.

The last edit of the main project was in late 2017, so to be completely honest I highly
doubt this is even being worked on anymore.

## Changes
### Implemented
* Some CSS changes, mainly to add fonts and just improve the CSS.
* Messages in [trans.pl](https://github.com/5qc/usemod/blob/master/misc/trans.pl) changed.

### Planned/Future
* Add spaces to the wiki names.
* Improve general layout of the wiki.
